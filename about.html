                <h2 class="fs-500 text-center">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>The world's population continues to grow. According to the UN, the current population is estimated at 7.7 billion. In 10 years we will reach 8.5 billion and 10 billion by 2050. But then, despite this rise in birth rate, we still lack flagship solutions today to boost the agricultural sector. In order to be able to guarantee a production and distribution of products that can satisfy the entire world population. Africa is today a land of opportunities, and this in many areas. Due to the diversity of its resources and the youthfulness of its population, Africa benefits from an impressive workforce. Nevertheless, it is also in the race for the development, even more modern of his countries. In these times of pandemic, which forces the world to change, Africa is not spared from it. This leads us to an even more urgent development of our economy, in order to be able to face these situations with dignity. And today one of the reference points for development is agriculture. It is a real catalyst for the development of the economy. Because to feed well remains a vital need for the human race. In this case, there is a major problem that is the current difficulty in effectively feeding the entire world population. Our company responds to this by providing solutions not only to the problem of production, but also to the distribution of our products worldwide. We are thus meeting these challenges as African entrepreneurs in order to promote not only the economic development of our States but above all to concretize our vision, in the very near future, of an industrial development of our company in the agribusiness sector.
                    Proud of our African values, we have great faith in the development and the emergence of Africa. Rwanda is today one of the countries with a quite admirable growth in Africa. We have a special admiration for this country. It is also a land of opportunity for many young people. In our case, KENGNE EMPIRE LIMITED intends to expand from there, not only its production capacity, but also its global network of distribution. In this extremely competitive market, we stand out for the quality of our products, reliability, but above all our professionalism and dynamism and this at each link in the production chain. With a constant increase in demand and supply, we want to provide our customers with quality products at unbeatable prices. By ensuring an exponential progress of our enterprise of course.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-500 text-center">Our History</h2>
                <p>KENGNE EMPIRE LIMITED (KEL) is a company specialized in agribusiness, based in Kigali, Rwanda. Due to its climate, the fertility of part of its land for the cultivation of certain products, in particular fruits and vegetables, Rwanda offers many opportunities for agricultural development. A proof of this is that a large part of the population lives mainly from agriculture which greatly participates in the country's economic development.
                    It is customary to say that the environment in which we grow up influences our state of mind. In our case, we grew up in an environment where business has always been advocated. This is what inspired us from a very young age to create our company. And today we created KENGNE EMPIRE LIMITED (KEL) which is a company that sells agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables. Africa, which is not only a strong point today in terms of agricultural development, but also the continent with the greatest growth demographic. Indeed, the number of births and the number of people constantly raises on our planet which is today a problem that challenges and worries all states. But who says population growth, also says increase in the consumption rate of the population. This justifies our vision in the agribusiness sector, which is to win the global market through to the reliability and quality of our products. But above all our professionalism and dynamism and this at every link in the production chain.
